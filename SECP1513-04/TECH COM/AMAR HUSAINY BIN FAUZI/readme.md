Design thinking helps me do this by teaching me to think creatively and consider what users really need. So, my plan is to use design thinking in my projects and learn from others. I'll join projects, connect with professionals, and keep up with what's new in tech. Learning never stops, so I'll attend workshops and find mentors to get better at both tech skills and creative problem-solving. That way, I can make a real impact in the tech world.  |
