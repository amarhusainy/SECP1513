| 1 | Assignment 1/Poster | From the career talk, one of the speakers suggestion is in
order to expand our skills and knowledge we need to find
someone that have some experienced in ICT industry and we
can learn from them. | 
| 2 | Assignment 2/Video | during the visit to UTM digital.I can clearly see how the environment and how the industry work.It open my mind and I realise that i need to improve in all aspect in order to fulfill the industry's need. | 
| 3 | Assignment 3/Report | Based on the talk,I do learned that the industry will keep growing and I
must always improve myself day by day in order to catch up with the
industry’s pace.I also learned that I must have some skills that others
don’t to secure my place in this ICT world.  | 
| 4 | Assignment 4/Newsletter | overall , it was a nice experience 0e
to go through , as it made us better
understand the industry and also
created an image of which
specialization in software would be
more suitable for some of us . |
| 5 | Quiz/PC Assemble | This activity taught me to recognise all the needs to build a complete pc and I am sure it will help me in my future.  |
| 6 | Project Phase 1 | This project taught me to work as a team and make me realise how important teamwork is.It also push me to be creative in order to think what we want to do in the project |
| 7 | Project Phase 2 | The survey results indicate a significant interest in improving the museum experience. 
The majority of respondents are open to using technology, with a substantial percentage having
familiarity with Augmented Reality. Given the comfort with mobile devices and a preference for
exploring exhibits at one's own pace, integrating AR applications into museums is likely to 
enhance visitor comfort and engagement. AR could fill the perceived gaps in the current 
museum experience, making it more interactive and enjoyable for a diverse audience. |
| 8 | Project Phase 3 | In this course, my goal is to learn a lot about tech and be ready for real-world problems. Design
thinking helps me do this by teaching me to think creatively and consider what users really need. So, my
plan is to use design thinking in my projects and learn from others. I'll join projects, connect with
professionals, and keep up with what's new in tech. Learning never stops, so I'll attend workshops and
find mentors to get better at both tech skills and creative problem-solving. That way, I can make a real
impact in the tech world. |
